# vpply-coding-test

Thank you for applying for a web developer role at Vpply. Clone this repository, complete the challenge and create a repository with your solution.
Email a link to the repository containing the solution to joseph@vpply.com when you are complete.

For this project, you will use Vuejs, so you will need to have nodejs and vuejs installed on your machine. you can see download instruction as well as documentation for vuejs in the links at the bottom.

## Instructions
In this coding test, you will build a web basic application that users can create business cards. Those cards will render in a list and display a name, job title, years of experience, mobile number and phone number the user enters inside text fields.

Watch the sample video in the root folder to see an example of what your solution should do.

Your solution does not need to look identical to the example, this test is just to show that you understand the basics of vuejs

There are some requirments you will need to follow, those include

 - use v-for to render the list of business cards

 - conditionally render the create new card functionality using v-if

 - v-model for data binding on the create new card feature

 - Use the BusinessCard component that has been defined already

 - Use v-bind to pass props to the BusinessCard component


Once you complete the test, push your solution to a git repository and share it via email to joseph@vpply.com

Good Luck!
