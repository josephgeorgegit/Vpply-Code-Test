  <p>Welcome to the Vpply Coding Test! </p>
      
      <p>In this coding test, you will build a basic application that users can create business cards using input fields. Those cards will render in a list.
        <br><br>
        Watch the sample video in the root folder to see an example of what your solution should do
        <br><br>
        Your solution does not need to look identical to the example, this test is just to show that you understand the basics of vuejs
        <br><br>
        There are some requirments you will need to follow, those include
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>use v-for to render the list of business cards</li>
          <li>conditionally render the create new card functionality using v-if</li>
          <li>v-model for data binding on the create new card feature</li>
          <li>Use the ListItem component that has been defined already</li>
          <li>Use v-bind to pass props to the ListItem component</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you complete the test, push your solution to a git repository and share it via email to joseph@vpply.com</p>
        <p>Good Luck!</p>
